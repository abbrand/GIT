learning GIT
my first file


Conte Ecology repository created by Dan on GitHub

make lots of small changes rather than large changes

git commit -m "inital commit"

local repository - hidden .git file on your computer(see diagram on Conte repository)

push to upstream repository (Github)
fetch from repository (if you pushed from another location, computer, etc.)

word files are binary so newer versions are recorded but it won't tell you individual changes line-by-line
text-based file changes are tracked on a line-by-line basis (code, etc.) and will be tracked by user if you are collaborating with others in a shared repository

git diff (checks changes between file versions since last commit) specify file name to check a certain file (i.e. git diff first.txt)


blah blah blah
